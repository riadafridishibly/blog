It's been a long time since I've spent any time working on my projects or my skill sets. Now I'm trying to go back to the track and started learning SQL. I know some basic things about SQL, perhaps too basic. I've started on SQL Cookbook. Previously I've completed pg-exercises. But I think I forgot most of the things. After all, I need to remember the 10,000 hours theory.
