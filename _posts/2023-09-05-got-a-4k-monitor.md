Recently, I've got a 4K monitor. LG ULTRAFINE 27-inch. I'm currently using it with my Macbook Air M1. The font rendering is superb. Judging by its font rendering it's a visual treat to the eyes. I love it.

### Why?

When I used Linux as my primary OS, I didn't bother much about monitor resolutions. 1080p was good enough for me. Because the font rendering in the terminal was good enough for me. But after switching to Mac, I noticed a significant difference in font rendering in the external monitor which is crazy. The resolution of the builtin display for mac M1 is 2560x1600. But if you use the default resolution option, it'll be shown as you're using a 1440x900 monitor. This way, you get crisp texts in the builtin display. There's a scaling factor of 2 and blah blah. TL;DR, with 1080p external monitor my font rendering was bad. To improve this issue, I need to buy a 5K monitor from Apple. Well not necessarily. I need a higher resolution monitor. The 5K monitor from apple is way too expensive for me. So I went with the best option in my budget. And Unsurprisingly, its very good. At least good enough for my use cases.


### Do you need one?

Probably no. If you can afford one and you work with lots of text documents, then maybe it'll be good for you. You may wanna consider this if you're doing graphics related things. But in such case you need to investigate into the color calibration as well.

### The problem with my old PC

Now that I've a 4K monitor I can no longer run this with my old PC. Because my motherboard has limitations. I can't run 4K 60FPS from that motherboard. It only supports 24FPS. Which is way too slow. And I don't have a graphics card. So I'm stuck here. I still use 1080p with my Linux setup.


### Conclusion

I don't think everyone needs a 4K monitor. But if you get one, you'll notice the font rendering is out of the world. Also you'll get more screen realstate. So more things will fit in the screen. Web browsing is also fun with high resolution display! Basically good text rendering changes everything.

Did I mention that the font rendering is excellent on the 4K monitor?
